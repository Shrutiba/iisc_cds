### GPT
Auto Regressive Generation (ARG) - Predicting the next word based on words (Tokens) predicted till then. This prediction continues till the model predicts end of scentences <br>
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) - it is the average of absolute diviation from the the mean <br>
Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) - it is the average of the square of the diviation <br>
Mean Root Squared Deviation (MRSQ) or Standard Deviation (SD) - Square root of the mean squared deviation <br>

**The sample data is enough if the probability values stops changing** <br>

Discrete Categorical Values : Have finite set of values <br>
Binary Categorical values : If it can have 2 values<br>
Multi class categorical values : It can have finite set of multiple possible values <br>

Random Variable : Value of this variable is not fixed <br>

Probability Distribution Functions <br>
  Probability Mass Function: Is a function that gives a probability of every entry in the sample space <br>

Continuous Variable <br>
   Mass -> Density - Mass / Unit Volume. In probability -> Density = Mass / Unit Length <br>
   Estimating probability density from data is a ML prb <br>

PMF and PDF exist for any discrete and continuous categorical values <br>
-  Burnouli Distribution <br>
-  Binomial Distributions <br>
-  Normal Distribution <br>

Numerical Variable : Numbers Continuous
Low cardinal
High Cardinal Numerical Variable : Continuous

### Conditional Probability
Y given X=x - P<sub>y/x</sub>(y/x) = P<sub>x,y</sub>/P<sub>x</sub><br>
Num : Joint distribution<br>
Denom : Marginal Distribution<br>
P<sub>y/x</sub>(y/x) - Conditional Distribution<br>

P<sub>x,y</sub>/P<sub>x</sub> 

### Independence
Causal variables and effects
Independent variables : They are distinct and noninteracting physical
If the variables are independent, there probability can be multiplied as they do not influence each other

### Correlation
If correlation between 2 variables is 0 then they are independent
-1 <= variable <= 0 Inversely related
0 <= variable <= 1 Directly related
